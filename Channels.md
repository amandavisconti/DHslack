This is a list of the DH Slack's channels (aka chat rooms focused on specific topics). These are user-created and user-run, and all members are welcome to create new channels (and announce any new channel you make in #introductions, so people know it exists). We will also periodically archive (mothball) inactive channels or merge channels with strongly overlapping topics to make the channel set easier to navigate, but any user can un-archive any archived channel at any time desired.

This page can be linked as [tinyurl.com/DHSlackChannels](http://tinyurl.com/DHSlackChannels) for ease of remembering.
