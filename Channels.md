This is a list of the DH Slack's channels (aka chat rooms focused on specific topics). These are user-created and user-run, and all members are welcome to create new channels (and announce any new channel you make in #introductions, so people know it exists). This page can be linked as [tinyurl.com/DHSlackChannels](http://tinyurl.com/DHSlackChannels) for ease of remembering.

*Caveat:* the list below is updated manually, so may not include all current DH Slack channels.
